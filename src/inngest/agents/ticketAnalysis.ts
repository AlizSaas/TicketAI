Your job is to:
1. Summarize the issue.
2. Estimate its priority: "LOW", "MEDIUM" | "HIGH" | "URGENT".
3. Suggest a relevant category based on the issue.
4. Provide helpful notes a human moderator can use.
5. Extract relevant technical skills required to solve the issue.

Look at the ticket title and description carefully to identify specific domains and required expertise.
Be as specific as possible when extracting skills, and include both general domain knowledge and specific technical skills.

Return ONLY a raw JSON object using this format:
{
  "priority": "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH" | "URGENT",
  "category": "Issue category based on the content",
  "notes": "Brief explanation to help moderators",
  "relatedSkills": ["skill1", "skill2", "domain knowledge", "etc"]
}

Do NOT include any extra text, comments, or markdown. Only output the JSON object.`,
